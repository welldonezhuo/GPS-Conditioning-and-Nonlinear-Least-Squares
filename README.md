# GPS-Conditioning-and-Nonlinear-Least-Squares

The project investigates how GPS works by solving the equations governing satellite-receiver positioning. 

ðŸ¤©Key topics include:

- The geometry of satellite signals and their intersections.
- Challenges in **clock synchronization and signal inaccuracie**s.
- Techniques to **enhance accuracy** by incorporating more satellites.
- Using **Python**, I numerically solve systems of nonlinear equations, simulate satellite configurations, and analyze the effects of varying satellite setups on positioning accuracy.
